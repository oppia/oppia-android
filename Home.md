Thanks for your interest in contributing to the Oppia project and making it easier for students to learn online effectively and enjoyably!

There are many ways to help out and become an Oppia contributor, from joining our team of lesson creators to fixing a bug in the [codebase](https://github.com/oppia/oppia-android/). Don't worry if you're new to "open source" or still a student -- many of our contributors are too, and we'd be happy to provide mentorship and support if this is your first time contributing to an open-source project. The main thing is that you care deeply about helping people worldwide learn something better and that you're responsible and reliable.

To make it easier to get started, we've catalogued some different ways to help out. Please feel free to take a look through them and see if any interest you:
