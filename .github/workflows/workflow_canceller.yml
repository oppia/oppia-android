name: Automatic Workflow Canceller

# This workflow should be triggered in one of three situations:
# 1. Manual workflow dispatch via https://github.com/oppia/oppia-android/actions.
# 2. Upon creation of a PR & updates to that PR.
#
# Note that the action being used here automatically accounts for the current branch & the commit
# hash of the tip of the branch to ensure it doesn't cancel previous workflows that aren't related
# to the branch being evaluated.
