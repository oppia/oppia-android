# [Oppia-Android](https://www.oppia.org)

Oppia-Android is a mobile application version of [Oppia](https://www.oppia.org). It is an android application that enables anyone to easily learn interactive activities (called 'explorations'). These activities simulate a one-on-one conversation with a tutor, making it possible for students to learn by doing while getting feedback.

In addition to that users can create their profile, pratice a set of skills, play with exporations, review previously finished skills and can also track the progress.

Oppia-Android app is written using Kotlin and python, and is built on top of Google App Engine.
