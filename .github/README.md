Oppia is an online learning tool that enables anyone to easily create and share interactive activities (called 'explorations'). These activities simulate a one-on-one conversation with a tutor, making it possible for students to learn by doing while getting feedback.

The Android app is a new, not-yet-released frontend for Oppia that provides access to Oppia's curated numeracy lessons for users who may not have regular access to internet connectivity, and in a way that can be easily shared across multiple members of the same household.

Oppia Android is written using Kotlin and Java, and leverages Bazel, databinding, Dagger 2, and AndroidX. See also:

## Development
The Oppia Android codebase is specifically designed to streamline development by utilizing design patterns that reduce the likelihood of making mistakes, and by leveraging powerful libraries and technologies to reduce the amount of code that needs to be written. See the [Overview of the Oppia Android codebase](https://github.com/oppia/oppia-android/wiki/Overview-of-the-Oppia-Android-codebase-and-architecture) wiki page for more specifics on the architecture. A brief list of libraries & technologies that the team makes significant use of:
- [Dagger](https://dagger.dev/)
- [Jetpack Databinding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/data-binding)
- [Jetpack LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata)
- [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) + [Kotlin Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines-overview.html)
- [Protobuffer](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers)
- [Bazel](https://bazel.build/)
- [Espresso](https://developer.android.com/training/testing/espresso) & [Robolectric for testing](http://robolectric.org/)
- And many more

The team puts special emphasis on writing high-quality, readable, maintainable, and well-tested code.
