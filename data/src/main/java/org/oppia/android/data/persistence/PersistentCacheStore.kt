/**
 * An on-disk persistent cache for proto messages that ensures reads and writes happen in a
 * well-defined order.
 *
 * Note that if this cache is used like a [DataProvider], there is a race condition between the
 * initial store's data being retrieved and any early writes to the store (writes generally win). If
 * this is not ideal, callers should use [primeInMemoryAndDiskCacheAsync] to synchronously kick-off
 * a read update to the store that is guaranteed to complete before any writes. This will be
 * reflected in the first time the store's state is delivered to a subscriber to a LiveData version
 * of this data provider. Note that this priming will always complete before any updates if it's
 * called before updates/reads.
 *
 * Note that this is a fast-response data provider, meaning it will provide a [AsyncResult.Pending]
 * result to subscribers immediately until the actual store is retrieved from disk.

   * monitored by treating this provider as a [DataProvider]. This method may result in an update
   * notification to observers of this [DataProvider].
   *
   * Note also that this method is particularly useful in two specific cases:
   * 1. When an instance of this cache needs to be loaded from disk before an update operation
   *   occurs (otherwise update() will likely complete before a load, overwriting the current
   *   on-disk cache state).
   * 2. When the cache needs to be initialized exactly once to a specific value (such as the case
   *   when an ID that cannot change after initialization needs to be generated and stored exactly
   *   once).
   *
   * Each of the above states are possible using different combinations of the provided [UpdateMode]
   * and [PublishMode] parameters.
   *
   * Finally, this method succeeding more or less guarantees that the cache store is now in a good
   * state (i.e. it will even recover from a corrupted or invalid disk cache file).
   *
   * @param updateMode how the cache should be changed (depending on whether it's been loaded yet,
   *     and whether it has an on-disk cache)
   * @param publishMode whether changes to the cache's in-memory copy during priming should be kept
   *     in-memory and sent to observers (otherwise, only store the results on-disk and do not
   *     notify changes). Note that the in-memory cache *will* be updated if it hasn't yet been
   *     initialized (which may mean saving a result from [update]).
   * @param update an optional function to transform the cache's current (in-memory if loaded, or
   *     from-disk if not) state to a new state, and then update the on-disk cache (and potentially
   *     the in-memory cache based on [publishMode]). Note that if the cache has not been loaded yet
   *     and has no on-disk copy then the cache's [initialValue] will be passed, instead. Omitting
   *     this transformation will just ensure the in-memory and/or on-disk cache are appropriately
