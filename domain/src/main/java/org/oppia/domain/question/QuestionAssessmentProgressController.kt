  /**
   * Submits an answer to the current question and returns how the UI should respond to this answer. The returned
   * [LiveData] will only have at most two results posted: a pending result, and then a completed success/failure
   * result. Failures in this case represent a failure of the app (possibly due to networking conditions). The app
   * should report this error in a consumable way to the user so that they may take action on it. No additional values
   * will be reported to the [LiveData]. Each call to this method returns a new, distinct, [LiveData] object that must
   * be observed. Note also that the returned [LiveData] is not guaranteed to begin with a pending state.
   *
   * If the app undergoes a configuration change, calling code should rely on the [LiveData] from [getCurrentQuestion]
   * to know whether a current answer is pending. That [LiveData] will have its state changed to pending during answer
   * submission and until answer resolution.
   *
   * Submitting an answer should result in the learner staying in the current question or moving to a new question in
   * the training session. Note that once a correct answer is processed, the current state reported to
   * [getCurrentQuestion] will change from a pending question to a completed question since the learner completed that
   * question card. The learner can then proceed from the current completed question to the next pending question using
   * [moveToNextQuestion].
   *
   * This method cannot be called until a training session has started and [getCurrentQuestion] returns a non-pending
   * result or the result will fail. Calling code must also take care not to allow users to submit an answer while a
   * previous answer is pending. That scenario will also result in a failed answer submission.
   *
   * No assumptions should be made about the completion order of the returned [LiveData] vs. the [LiveData] from
   * [getCurrentQuestion]. Also note that the returned [LiveData] will only have a single value and not be reused after
   * that point.
