<i>3</i>&nbsp;// TODO(#1274): Add thorough testing for this class.
<i>4</i>&nbsp;
<i>5</i>&nbsp;/**
<i>6</i>&nbsp; * Helper class to coordinate execution between all threads currently running in a test environment
<i>7</i>&nbsp; * in a way that&#39;s interoperable with both Robolectric &amp; Espresso to guarantee background &amp; UI
<i>8</i>&nbsp; * thread synchronization and determinism.
<i>9</i>&nbsp; *
<i>10</i>&nbsp; * This class should be used at any point in a test where the test should ensure that a clean thread
<i>11</i>&nbsp; * synchronization point is needed (such as after an async operation is kicked off). This class can
<i>12</i>&nbsp; * guarantee that all threads enter a truly idle state (e.g. even in cases where execution &quot;ping
<i>13</i>&nbsp; * pongs&quot; across multiple threads will still be resolved with a single call to [runCurrent],
<i>14</i>&nbsp; * [advanceTimeBy], or [advanceUntilIdle]).
<i>15</i>&nbsp; *
<i>16</i>&nbsp; * Note that it&#39;s recommended all Robolectric tests that utilize this class run in a PAUSED looper
<i>17</i>&nbsp; * mode so that clock coordination is consistent between Robolectric&#39;s scheduler and this utility
<i>18</i>&nbsp; * class, otherwise unexpected inconsistencies may arise.
<i>19</i>&nbsp; *
<i>20</i>&nbsp; * It&#39;s also recommended that all Espresso tests register the idling resource provided by this class
<i>21</i>&nbsp; * (see [registerIdlingResource]) to get the same synchronization benefits of the
<i>22</i>&nbsp; * Robolectric-specific API methods (e.g. [runCurrent], [advanceTimeBy], and [advanceUntilIdle]).
<i>23</i>&nbsp; *
<i>24</i>&nbsp; * *NOTE TO DEVELOPERS*: This class is NOT yet ready for broad use in Espresso until after #89 is
<i>25</i>&nbsp; * fully resolved. Please ask in oppia-android-dev if you have a use case that you think requires
<i>26</i>&nbsp; * this class. Specific cases will be allowed to integrate with if other options are infeasible.
<i>27</i>&nbsp; * Other tests should rely on existing mechanisms until this utility is ready for broad use. All
<i>28</i>&nbsp; * Robolectric tests should use this class instead of manually creating their own test dispatchers.

<i>32</i>&nbsp;   * Registers an Espresso idling resource.
<i>33</i>&nbsp;   *
<i>34</i>&nbsp;   * Espresso tests use a real-time clock which means the normal synchronization mechanisms that
<i>35</i>&nbsp;   * this API provides (e.g. [runCurrent] and [advanceTimeBy]) are insufficient for proper
<i>36</i>&nbsp;   * synchronization (in fact, these methods effectively do nothing for Espresso tests). Instead, an
<i>37</i>&nbsp;   * idling resource allows the Espresso framework to synchronize the main thread against background
<i>38</i>&nbsp;   * coroutine dispatchers--it will stop Espresso actions &amp; matchers from running while there are
<i>39</i>&nbsp;   * pending tasks. To ensure deterministic behavior, this class guarantees *all* coroutines will be
<i>40</i>&nbsp;   * completed prior to Espresso reaching an idle state (even if those coroutines are scheduled for
<i>41</i>&nbsp;   * the feature or are scheduled as the result of another coroutine executing).
<i>42</i>&nbsp;   *
<i>43</i>&nbsp;   * All tests targeting Espresso &amp; Robolectric should make use of both the idling resource &amp; direct
<i>44</i>&nbsp;   * synchronization APIs that this class provides.
<i>45</i>&nbsp;   *
<i>46</i>&nbsp;   * [unregisterIdlingResource] should be used during test tear-down to ensure the resource is
<i>47</i>&nbsp;   * de-registered.
