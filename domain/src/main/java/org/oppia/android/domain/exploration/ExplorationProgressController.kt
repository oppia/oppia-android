   * Submits an answer to the current state and returns how the UI should respond to this answer.
   * The returned [LiveData] will only have at most two results posted: a pending result, and then a

   * (possibly due to networking conditions). The app should report this error in a consumable way
   * to the user so that they may take action on it. No additional values will be reported to the
   * [LiveData]. Each call to this method returns a new, distinct, [LiveData] object that must be
   * observed. Note also that the returned [LiveData] is not guaranteed to begin with a pending
   * state.
   *
   * If the app undergoes a configuration change, calling code should rely on the [LiveData] from
   * [getCurrentState] to know whether a current answer is pending. That [LiveData] will have its
   * state changed to pending during answer submission and until answer resolution.
   *
   * Submitting an answer should result in the learner staying in the current state, moving to a new
   * state in the exploration, being shown a concept card, or being navigated to another exploration
   * altogether. Note that once a correct answer is processed, the current state reported to
   * [getCurrentState] will change from a pending state to a completed state since the learner
   * completed that card. The learner can then proceed from the current completed state to the next
   * pending state using [moveToNextState].
   *
   * This method cannot be called until an exploration has started and [getCurrentState] returns a
   * non-pending result or the result will fail. Calling code must also take care not to allow users
   * to submit an answer while a previous answer is pending. That scenario will also result in a
   * failed answer submission.
   *
   * No assumptions should be made about the completion order of the returned [LiveData] vs. the
   * [LiveData] from  [getCurrentState]. Also note that the returned [LiveData] will only have a
   * single value and not be reused after that point.
