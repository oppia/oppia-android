   * If the app undergoes a configuration change, calling code should rely on the [DataProvider]

   * have its state changed to pending during answer submission and until answer resolution.

   * ### Lifecycle behavior
   * The returned [DataProvider] will initially be pending until the operation completes (unless
   * called before a session is started). Note that a different provider is returned for each call,
   * though it's tied to the same session so it can be monitored medium-term (i.e. for the duration
   * of the play session, but not past it). Furthermore, the returned provider does not actually
   * need to be monitored in order for the operation to complete, though it's recommended since
   * [getCurrentQuestion] can only be used to monitor the effects of the operation, not whether the
   * operation itself succeeded.
   *
   * If this is called before a session begins it will return a provider that stays failing with no
   * updates. The operation will also silently fail rather than queue up in these circumstances, so
   * starting a session will not trigger an answer submission from an older call.
   *
   * Multiple subsequent calls during a valid session will queue up and have results delivered in
   * order (though based on the eventual consistency nature of [DataProvider]s no assumptions can be
   * made about whether all results will actually be received--[getCurrentQuestion] should be used
   * as the source of truth for the current state of the session).
   *
   * No assumptions should be made about the completion order of the returned [DataProvider] vs. the
   * [DataProvider] from [getCurrentQuestion].
