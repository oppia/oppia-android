   * Submits an answer to the current question and returns how the UI should respond to this answer.
   * The returned [LiveData] will only have at most two results posted: a pending result, and then a
   * completed success/failure result. Failures in this case represent a failure of the app
   * (possibly due to networking conditions). The app should report this error in a consumable way
   * to the user so that they may take action on it. No additional values will be reported to the
   * [LiveData]. Each call to this method returns a new, distinct, [LiveData] object that must be
   * observed. Note also that the returned [LiveData] is not guaranteed to begin with a pending
   * state.
   *
   * If the app undergoes a configuration change, calling code should rely on the [LiveData] from
   * [getCurrentQuestion] to know whether a current answer is pending. That [LiveData] will have its
   * state changed to pending during answer submission and until answer resolution.
   *
   * Submitting an answer should result in the learner staying in the current question or moving to
   * a new question in the training session. Note that once a correct answer is processed, the
   * current state reported to [getCurrentQuestion] will change from a pending question to a
   * completed question since the learner completed that question card. The learner can then proceed
   * from the current completed question to the next pending question using [moveToNextQuestion].
   *
   * This method cannot be called until a training session has started and [getCurrentQuestion]
   * returns a non-pending result or the result will fail. Calling code must also take care not to
   * allow users to submit an answer while a previous answer is pending. That scenario will also
   * result in a failed answer submission.
   *
   * No assumptions should be made about the completion order of the returned [LiveData] vs. the
   * [LiveData] from [getCurrentQuestion]. Also note that the returned [LiveData] will only have a
   * single value and not be reused after that point.
