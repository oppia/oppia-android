 * # Logic for selecting a hint
 *
 * Hints are selected based on the availability of hints to show, and any previous hints that have
 * been shown. A new hint will only be made available if its previous hint has been viewed by the
 * learner. Hints are always shown in order. If all hints have been exhausted and viewed by the
 * user, then the 'hint available' state in the diagram above will trigger the solution to be
 * made available to view, if a solution is present. Once the solution is viewed by the learner,
 * they will reach a terminal state for hints and no additional hints or solutions will be made
 * available.
