 * 1. This class is the sole decision maker for whether a hint is available or revealed (and ditto
 *    for solutions)
 * 2. Hints must be viewed in order
 * 3. Later hints are not available until all previous hints have been revealed
 * 4. The solution cannot be revealed until all previous hints have been revealed
 *
 * Implementations of this class are not safe to access across multiple threads, and will block the
 * calling thread.
