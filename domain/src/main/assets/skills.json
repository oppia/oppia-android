				"html": "\u003cp\u003eWhen you see a multiplication expression with more than two factors, like 8 * 4 * 3, it is up to you which of the multiplication operations you want to perform first. You'll get the same result either way.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor example, 8 * 4 * 3 could be solved by writing it as \u003cstrong\u003e(8 * 4) * 3\u003c/strong\u003e, or as \u003cstrong\u003e8 * (4 * 3)\u003c/strong\u003e. The parentheses indicate the operation that should be done first. For instance, if we have to compute (8 * 4) * 3, we first evaluate (8 * 4) = 32. Then, we can use that to get \u003cstrong\u003e(8 * 4) \u003c/strong\u003e* 3\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003e=\u003cstrong\u003e 32 \u003c/strong\u003e* 3 = 96.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn general, whenever you have numbers a, b, and c, (a * b) * c = a * (b * c). Both those expressions have the same answer. This property is called the \u003cstrong\u003eAssociative Property \u003c/strong\u003eof Multiplication, which states that, if you multiply a bunch of numbers, you will get the same answer no matter which operation you perform first.\u0026nbsp;Note that the Associative Property only holds for addition and multiplication, but not subtraction and division.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis property can be useful for simplifying multiplication expressions. For example, if you wanted to calculate 35937 * 2 * 5, you could start by calculating 35937 * 2, and then multiplying the result by 5. But it would be easier to perform the last multiplication first. This would give you:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; 3537 * 2 * 5 = 3537 * (2 * 5) (let's start with the second multiplication)\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; = 3537 * 10 (easy to calculate!)\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; = 35370.\u003c/p\u003e"

Repeat until you run out of digits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis works because the larger places\u0026nbsp;have the largest values, so you'll want to put the largest digits there to make the value of the resulting number as big as possible.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eExample\u003c/strong\u003e:\u0026nbsp;Say we are given the digits 6, 1, 9, 7, and 5. The largest digit is the 9, so we place it on the left. The remaining digits in decreasing order are 7, 6, 5, and 1. So, our final number is \u003cstrong\u003e97651\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf two or more digits have the same value, then it doesn't matter which digit you use first!\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eExample\u003c/strong\u003e: Let us arrange the digits 4, 6, 6, and 7 to make the largest possible number. The smallest digit is 4, so it goes in the ones place. There are two 6s, so we put one each in the tens and hundreds place. That leaves the 7 for the thousands place. Our final number is \u003cstrong\u003e7664\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e------------------------------------------------------------------------\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhat if we want to create the \u003cem\u003esmallest\u003c/em\u003e number?\u0026nbsp;We can do a similar thing: place the smallest digit on the far left, and work our way to the right one digit at a time.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eExample\u003c/strong\u003e: To order 2, 8, 4, and 1, we place the smallest digit, 1, on the far left. The second-smallest digit, 2, goes to the right of the 1. Similarly, 4 goes to the right of the 2, and 8 is furthest to the right. Our final answer is \u003cstrong\u003e1248\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen creating the smallest number, be careful when zeroes are involved! We can't place zeroes in the front of a number. So, to make the smallest number possible, we first place\u0026nbsp;the smallest \u003cem\u003enon-zero\u003c/em\u003e digit and place it in the far left. Then, we can continue with\u0026nbsp;the zeroes and the remaining digits.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eExample\u003c/strong\u003e: To order 0, 0, 2, 3\u0026nbsp;and 9 into the smallest possible number, we might want to write 00239. But that won't work, because numbers shouldn't start with 0, and this \"number\" would usually be written as 239. So, our first digit must be the smallest non-zero digit, which is 2. After that, we can use the digits in increasing order, and the correct arrangement is 0, 0,\u0026nbsp;3 and 9. So, the smallest number we can form is \u003cstrong\u003e20039\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e"

Then, we add 8 to the sum to get 628.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSecond, because we are given a sum of digit values, we can figure out that the original number should have the same digit values as our breakdown.

To do this, we need to be able to look at two numbers, and \u003cstrong\u003ecompare\u003c/strong\u003e\u0026nbsp;them by figuring\u0026nbsp;out which one is larger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWe have a special set of symbols that help us compare numbers:\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eThe \"less than\" symbol (\u0026lt;)\u0026nbsp;tells us that the left number is smaller than the right number. For example: 1 \u0026lt; 4, 16 \u0026lt; 809, and 999 \u0026lt; 1000.\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eThe \"greater than\" symbol (\u0026gt;)\u0026nbsp;tells us that the left number is greater than the right number. For example: 52 \u0026gt; 20, 109 \u0026gt; 71, and 10387019375032 \u0026gt; 1.\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eThe \"equals\" symbol (=) tells us that the numbers on each side\u0026nbsp;of it are the same size. For example, 5 = 5, 73 = 70 + 3, and 109010941801 = 109010941801.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYou can think of the \"\u0026lt;\" and\u0026nbsp;\"\u0026gt;\" symbols as \"little mouths\".\u0026nbsp;The mouth opens wider towards the larger number!\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eComparing two numbers\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo compare two numbers, start by\u0026nbsp;figuring\u0026nbsp;out which number has more places (or more digits). If one number contains a place value that the other doesn't, then it must be larger.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eExample: Let's compare\u0026nbsp;2019 and 514. Notice that\u0026nbsp;2019 contains a thousands digit, but 514 doesn't. So, \u003cstrong\u003e2019\u003c/strong\u003e must be the larger number.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eNow, you try it! Convince yourself that 109 \u0026gt; 70, 6091 \u0026gt; 614, and 9999999 \u0026lt; 10000000 are all true.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e-----------------------------------------------------------\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut what if both numbers have the same number of digits? Then,\u0026nbsp;we look at each digit one by one, starting from the largest place value.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eExample: Let's compare 5109\u0026nbsp;and 7102.\u0026nbsp;We compare the thousands digit first. Because 5 \u0026lt; 7, we see that\u0026nbsp;the second number (7102) is bigger, so we write\u0026nbsp;5109\u0026nbsp;\u0026lt; 7102.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eNow, what if\u0026nbsp;both digits in the largest place are equal? Then, we compare the next largest place value. If those are equal, then we go to the next digit, and so on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eExample: Let's compare 298127 and 259613. The hundred thousands places are\u0026nbsp;equal, so we compare the ten thousands places next. These are different, and since\u0026nbsp;9 \u0026gt; 5, this means 298127 \u0026gt; 259613.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, if all the digits in the numbers are equal, then the two numbers are equal.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSorting a list of numbers\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTo sort more than two numbers, we can do the same thing as before.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eFirst, group the numbers by how many digits they have. The more digits, the larger the number.\u003c/li\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eThen, in each group, compare the numbers starting from the leftmost (highest) digit.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eExample: Let's try to sort the numbers\u0026nbsp;94, 47, 79, and 49. All of these numbers have 2 digits, so we start by comparing the highest (tens) digit. Since 4 \u0026lt; 7 \u0026lt; 9, we know that 94 is largest, 79 is next, and the other two numbers are smaller.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eBut what about 47 and 49? Those have the same tens digit, so we look at the next (ones) digit. Since 7 \u0026lt; 9, this tells us that 47 \u0026lt; 49.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003ePutting all this together, we see that 47 \u0026lt; 49 \u0026lt; 79 \u0026lt; 94. So, the order from smallest to largest would be 47, 49, 79, 94, and the order from largest to smallest is 94, 79, 49, 47.\u003c/p\u003e"
