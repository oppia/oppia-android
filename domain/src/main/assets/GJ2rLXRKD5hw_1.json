Fraction of a whole: When we divide a whole into equal parts, each part is a fraction of the whole. A fraction has two parts. The number on the top of the line is called the numerator. It tells how many equal parts of the whole or collection are taken.  The number below the line is called the denominator.  It shows the total divisible number of equal parts the whole into or the total number of equal parts which are there in a collection. Also, here's the equation for a line using in-line LaTeX: <oppia-noninteractive-math render-type=\"inline\" math_content-with-value=\"{&amp;quot;raw_latex&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;y=mx+b&amp;quot;}\" /><p><oppia-noninteractive-math render-type=\"block\" math_content-with-value=\"{&amp;quot;raw_latex&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;(x + 1)(x - 2) = \\\\frac{(x ^ {3} + 2x ^ {2} - 5x - 6)}{(x + b)}&amp;quot;}\" /><p><oppia-noninteractive-math render-type=\"block\" math_content-with-value=\"{&amp;quot;raw_latex&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;y=mx+b&amp;quot;}\" /><p><oppia-noninteractive-math render-type=\"block\" math_content-with-value=\"{&amp;quot;raw_latex&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{\\\\frac{\\\\frac{\\\\frac{\\\\frac{\\\\frac{\\\\frac{\\\\frac{1}{2}}{3}}{4}}{5}}{6}}{7}}{8}}{9}}&amp;quot;}\" />"
