Even if we switch the factors, we will get the same product.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor example, 5 * 2 and 2 * 5 both equal the same number, 10:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003coppia-noninteractive-image alt-with-value=\"\u0026amp;quot;Image showing 5 * 2 = 2 * 5.

Each row has five chocolate squares. A multiplication expression we can use to find the total number of chocolate squares is 2 * 5.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, we can also see that there are five columns of chocolate squares. In this case, each row has two chocolate squares. Another multiplication expression we can use to find the total number of chocolate squares here is 5 * 2.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThese two expressions represent the same amount of chocolate. In other words, 5 * 2 = 2 * 5, because they both equal 10. The order of the factors has no effect on the product.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eExample 1\u003c/strong\u003e: Does 3 * 5 * 2 have the same product as 5 * 2 * 3?\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSolution 1\u003c/strong\u003e: Yes. Because both expressions are multiplying the same numbers together, they both have the same product, 30, by the Commutative Property. The order of the factors is not important.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eExample 2\u003c/strong\u003e:\u0026nbsp; 45 * 901 * 667 = 27043515. With this information, evaluate 901 * 667 * 45.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSolution 2\u003c/strong\u003e: The question asks for the answer to\u0026nbsp; 901 * 667 * 45.

It told us that 45 * 901 * 667 = 27043515. Because 45 * 901 * 667 has the same factors as\u0026nbsp;901 * 667 * 45 in a different order, the two expressions will have the same product by the Commutative Property of Multiplication.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn this way, we know that 901 * 667 * 45 = 27043515 without having to write down and solve anything! Knowing the Commutative Property of Multiplication saved us a lot of time.\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Associative Property of Multiplication\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn a mathematical expression with more than two numbers, sometimes, numbers are grouped using parentheses, like this:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003coppia-noninteractive-image alt-with-value=\"\u0026amp;quot;Image showing ((2 * 5) * 9) * 3.\u0026amp;quot;\" caption-with-value=\"\u0026amp;quot;\u0026amp;quot;\" filepath-with-value=\"\u0026amp;quot;img_20200712_010903_7x62q2idqk_height_60_width_245.png\u0026amp;quot;\"\u003e\u003c/oppia-noninteractive-image\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn expressions with parentheses, the part inside the parentheses has to be computed first. In this example, (2 * 5) * 9 is inside a pair of parentheses, and inside that expression , 2 * 5 is inside its own pair of parentheses. Therefore, 2 * 5 is multiplied first, and that equals 10. Next, 10 is multiplied with 9. Finally 90 is multiplied with 3.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Associative Property of Multiplication says that the product of a multiplication expression with three or more numbers is the same regardless of how those numbers are grouped.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eFor example,\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003coppia-noninteractive-image alt-with-value=\"\u0026amp;quot;Image showing ((2 * 5) * 9) * 3 (same as before).\u0026amp;quot;\" caption-with-value=\"\u0026amp;quot;\u0026amp;quot;\" filepath-with-value=\"\u0026amp;quot;img_20200712_011047_dkw4xosol4_height_60_width_245.png\u0026amp;quot;\"\u003e\u003c/oppia-noninteractive-image\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003ehas the same product as:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003coppia-noninteractive-image alt-with-value=\"\u0026amp;quot;Image showing (2 * 5) * (9 * 3).\u0026amp;quot;\" caption-with-value=\"\u0026amp;quot;\u0026amp;quot;\" filepath-with-value=\"\u0026amp;quot;img_20200712_011057_akr64gc8rd_height_67_width_245.png\u0026amp;quot;\"\u003e\u003c/oppia-noninteractive-image\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eeven though the order of multiplication is different in these two expressions. Both expressions evaluate to 270.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe order in which numbers are grouped when they are multiplied does not matter. This is because no matter how they are grouped, we are still multiplying the same numbers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Distributive Property of Multiplication\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Distributive Property of Multiplication can be used to simplify problems with multi-digit multiplication by writing multi-digit factors as addition expressions.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe Distributive Property of Multiplication states that when a number is multiplied with a sum of two numbers, the multiplication problem can be solved by writing it as an addition expression, and \u201cdistributing\u201d each part of each addition expression.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIn the example below,\u0026nbsp;225 is written out as (200 + 20 + 5), and each part of that addition expression is multiplied by 5, and added up:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003coppia-noninteractive-image alt-with-value=\"\u0026amp;quot;Diagram showing the distributive property of multiplication: 225 * 5 = (200 + 20 + 5) * 5 = (200 * 5) + (20 * 5) + (5 * 5).\u0026amp;quot;\" caption-with-value=\"\u0026amp;quot;\u0026amp;quot;\" filepath-with-value=\"\u0026amp;quot;img_20200713_022712_i0htjf2t79_height_108_width_343.svg\u0026amp;quot;\"\u003e\u003c/oppia-noninteractive-image\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThis also works if there are multiple terms in both factors.
