In these situations, it is important to find the answers quickly. Having all the small multiplication expressions memorized is very useful when we want to solve problems quickly, because all we need to do is remember them!\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eExample\u003c/strong\u003e: Tara and Amala are young women selling mangoes in a very busy market. There are many people waiting impatiently in line to buy mangoes.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eTara knows that if she sells mangoes faster than Amala, she will make more money than her.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA customer wants to buy three pounds of mangoes from Tara\u2019s fruit cart. A second customer wants three pounds of mangoes from Amala\u2019s fruit cart.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eIf each pound of mangoes costs $8, how much do three pounds of mangoes cost?\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSolution:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/strong\u003eA multiplication expression to find how much three mangoes cost is 8 * 3, because the customer wants three pounds of mangoes and each pound costs $8. Because Tara memorized her multiples, she immediately knows that 8 * 3 = 24.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, Amala never memorized her multiples. Because she cannot multiply fast, Amala is slow at selling mangoes and makes very little money. But Tara can solve multiplication problems very fast and always makes more money than Amala.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMemorizing by writing\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we memorize the multiples, it becomes much faster for us to solve simple multiplication problems. One way of memorizing multiplication expressions and their products is to practice \u003cstrong\u003ewriting them down\u003c/strong\u003e every day on a piece of paper, like this:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003coppia-noninteractive-image alt-with-value=\"\u0026amp;quot;Multiplication tables from 1 to 5.\u0026amp;quot;\" caption-with-value=\"\u0026amp;quot;\u0026amp;quot;\" filepath-with-value=\"\u0026amp;quot;img_20200712_202737_21rpzdr0ex_height_448_width_490.png\u0026amp;quot;\"\u003e\u003c/oppia-noninteractive-image\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eWhen you do this every day, even for a week, you will get \u003cstrong\u003emuch, much faster\u003c/strong\u003e at solving multiplication problems like 3 * 5 or 9 * 8 because you have already seen them before!\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow to use a multiplication table\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eA multiplication table is a useful tool where we can find the products to single-digit multiples. It is useful when first starting out with multiplication and also helpful for memorizing our multiples.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003coppia-noninteractive-image alt-with-value=\"\u0026amp;quot;A multiplication grid with 1-9 along both the row and column axes.

The box that is in this row and this column contains the product of the two numbers.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003coppia-noninteractive-image alt-with-value=\"\u0026amp;quot;The same multiplication table, but with row 4 circled and column 3 circled.

This is how we can see that 4 * 3 = 12.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eExample\u003c/strong\u003e: Evaluate 9 * 6 using the multiplication table.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSolution\u003c/strong\u003e: Our first factor is 9, so the product has to be in the row of number 9.
