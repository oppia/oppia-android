/**
 * An [Iterator] for [Sequence]s that may have exactly up to 1 element lookahead.
 *
 * This iterator is intended to be used by tokenizers and parsers to force an LL(1) implementation
 * of both (since only one token may be observed before retrieval). Further, this implementation is
 * intentionally limited to sequences for potential performance: since no more than one element
 * requires lookahead, having a backed array is unnecessary which means a potentially expensive and
 * fully dynamic sequence could back the iterator. While especially large inputs aren't expected,
 * they are inherently supported by the implementation with no additional overhead.
 *
 * New implementations can be created using [toPeekableIterator].
 *
 * This class is not safe to use across multiple threads and requires synchronization.
