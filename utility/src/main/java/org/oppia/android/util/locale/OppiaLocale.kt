/**
 * Represents a locale in the app. This is similar to Android's locale in that all locale-based
 * operations should go through this class.
 *
 * However, it's different in that:
 * 1. Some locales must be retrieved asynchronously through domain controllers since the validity of
 *    the locale is verified against the app's own language & region configurations
 * 2. Because of (1), instances of this class are guaranteed to be supported by the app
 * 3. Different subclasses of the locale exist to serve different purposes (such as processing
 *    strings, or computing user-displayable strings). This is conceptually similar Android's locale
 *    categories introduced in API 24.
 * 4. All code in the app must use this class for locale-based operations (as backed by enforced
 *    regex CI checks) to ensure locale correctness in different contexts
 *
 * See [org.oppia.android.domain.locale.LocaleController] for retrieving instances of this class,
 * and at its subclasses below for the different locale APIs that are available.
 *
 * Finally, all implementations of this class will be hashable & have equals implementations such
 * different instances of this class will be equivalent so long as they are _functionally_ the same
 * locale (which generally means that they are of the same class type and have the same
 * [localeContext]). Further, subclasses will have custom [toString] implementations for improved
 * logging messaging.
