We are grateful for the support of [Translatewiki](https://translatewiki.net/w/i.php?title=Special:Translate&group=oppia-android-app&filter=%21translated&action=translate) in contributing internationalized platform strings for the Oppia Android app! (Note that Translatewiki only provides support for translations of platform UI strings; content string translations are handled via the Contributor Dashboard on the Oppia.org website.)

## Helping out with translations

If you would like to help out with translations, you can do so by visiting the [Translatewiki dashboard](https://translatewiki.net/w/i.php?title=Special:Translate&group=oppia-android-app&filter=%21translated&action=translate) and picking a supported language from the dropdown menu on the right.

## Policy for enabling new languages

Note that we only enable a select set of languages for Translatewiki. This is because we also need the lessons themselves to be sufficiently translated before we can offer the app in a given language. Therefore, in order not to waste translators' efforts, the policy for enabling languages for translation on Translatewiki is as follows:

  - The translations for all lessons in the Place Values, Addition and Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, Fractions and Ratios topics on Oppia.org should be complete, or very close to complete.

And the policy for enabling a language in the Android app is as follows:

  - The translations for all lessons in the Place Values, Addition and Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, Fractions and Ratios topics on Oppia.org should be complete.
  - All translations for that language are completed in Translatewiki.

## Procedure for enabling new languages

### To enable a new language in Translatewiki

Please do the following steps:

  1. Verify that translations for all lessons in the Place Values, Addition and Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, Fractions and Ratios topics on Oppia.org are complete (or very close to complete) in that language, by going to the Contributor Dashboard and checking that there are no (or very few) translations left to do.
  2. Contact Ben/Sean and ask them to add the language to the oppia-android-app project. (They will do this by contacting Abijeet at translatewiki).

### To enable a new language in the Android app

Please do the following steps:

  1. Verify that translations for all lessons in the Place Values, Addition and Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, Fractions and Ratios topics on Oppia.org are complete in that language, by going to the Contributor Dashboard and checking that there are no translations left to do.
  2. Verify that the translations on [Translatewiki](https://translatewiki.net/w/i.php?title=Special:Translate&group=oppia-android-app&filter=%21translated&action=translate) for the Oppia Android app are complete in that language.
  3. In consultation with Ben, make a PR adding support for that language ([here](https://github.com/oppia/oppia-android/pull/4307/files) is an example for Swahili).
