/**
 * Tests for [AndroidBuildSdkProperties].
 *
 * Note that these tests have a few caveats:
 * 1. They are a bit fragile since they're directly testing the local Bazel configuration. As the
 *   team changes its dependency versions in the future, this suite will need to be updated.
 * 2. There's no way to test the "failing state" since the build graph guarantees that the SDK info
 *   file is included at runtime. The implementation makes this assumption, as well.
