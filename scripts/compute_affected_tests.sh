# Compute the list of tests that are affected by changes on this branch (including in the working
# directory). This script is useful to verify that only the tests that could break due to a change
# are actually verified as passing. Note that this script does not actually run any of the tests.
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/compute_affected_tests.sh <bazel_path>
#
# This script is based on https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/blob/d96e1cd/scripts/ci/ci.sh and the
# documentation at https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/query.html. Note that this script will
# automatically list all tests if it's run on the develop branch (the idea being that test
# considerations on the develop branch should always consider all targets).
