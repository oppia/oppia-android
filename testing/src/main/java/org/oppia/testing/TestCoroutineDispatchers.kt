/**
 * Helper class to coordinate execution between all threads currently running in a test environment,
 * using both Robolectric for the main thread and [TestCoroutineDispatcher] for application-specific
 * threads.
 *
 * This class should be used at any point in a test where the test should ensure that a clean thread
 * synchronization point is needed (such as after an async operation is kicked off). This class can
 * guarantee that all threads enter a truly idle state (e.g. even in cases where execution "ping
 * pongs" across multiple threads will still be resolved with a single call to [advanceUntilIdle]).
 *
 * Note that it's recommended all Robolectric tests that utilize this class run in a PAUSED looper
 * mode so that clock coordination is consistent between Robolectric's scheduler and this utility
 * class, otherwise unexpected inconsistencies may arise.
 *
 * *NOTE TO DEVELOPERS*: This class is NOT yet ready for broad use until after #89 is resolved.
 * Please ask in oppia-android-dev if you have a use case that you think requires this class.
 * Specific cases will be allowed to integrate with if other options are infeasible. Other tests
 * should rely on existing mechanisms until this utility is ready for broad use.
