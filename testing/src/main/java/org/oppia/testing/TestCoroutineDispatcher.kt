/**
 * Replacement for Kotlin's test coroutine dispatcher that can be used to replace coroutine
 * dispatching functionality in Robolectric & Espresso tests in a way that can be coordinated across
 * multiple dispatchers for execution synchronization.
 *
 * Developers should never use this dispatcher directly. Integrating with it should be done via
 * [TestDispatcherModule] and ensuring thread synchronization should be done via
 * [TestCoroutineDispatchers]. Attempting to interact directly with this dispatcher may cause timing
 * inconsistencies between the UI thread and other application coroutine dispatchers.
 *
 * Further, no assumptions should be made about the coordination functionality of this utility on
 * Robolectric or Espresso. The implementation carefully manages the differences between these two
 * platforms, so tests should only rely on the API. See [TestCoroutineDispatchers] for more details
 * on how to properly integrate with the test coroutine dispatcher API.
