 * Note while this service is being thoroughly tested, both the implementation and tests are based
 * on a specific interpretation of the [ExecutorService] API. As a result, This class is
 * **NOT PRODUCTION READY**. It should _only_ be used for testing purposes. This class should be
 * used for APIs that rely on a Java executor for background activity that must be synchronized with
 * other Oppia operations in tests. Uses of this class will automatically be compatible with
 * [TestCoroutineDispatchers] and its idling resource.
 *
 * Note also that the built-in executor service (as suggested by
 * https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.coroutines/issues/1450) is not used because that assumes the
 * underlying dispatcher is an ExecutorService which may not necessarily be the case, and it doesn't
 * allow cooperation with Oppia's test coroutine dispatchers utility (which is the purpose of this
